# PhoneBook API

The *PhoneBook API* contains the code for the developed API (backend side) of the *PhoneBook App*.


## Installation of the App

1. Fork and clone this repository.

2. Navigate from your terminal inside the /src/backend directory and run ***npm install*** or ***npm i*** to install the dependencies of the app.


## Running the App Locally

1. Make sure that all the dependencies of the *PhoneBook API* are installed.

2. Create **YOUR_OWN_MONGODB_URI** as specified in the [**README_DB_CONNECTION**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/phonebook_app/blob/master/README_DB_CONNECTION.md) file in the root directory of this repository.

3. In the **.env** file at the root of the project set the *'MONGODB_URI'* variable with the value of **YOUR_OWN_MONGODB_URI**.

4. Navigate from your terminal inside the /src/backend directory and run ***npm run start*** to start the server of the API.


## Linting the App

1. Make sure that all the dependencies of the *PhoneBook API* are installed.

2. Navigate from your terminal inside the /src/backend directory and run ***npm run lint***.


## Command-line Database

1. Make sure that all the dependencies of the *PhoneBook API* are installed.

2. Create **YOUR_OWN_MONGODB_URI** as specified in the [**README_DB_CONNECTION**](https://github.com/katerina-tziala/phonebook_app/blob/master/README_DB_CONNECTION.md) file in the root directory of this repository.

3. In the **mongo.js** file at the root of the project set the *'DB_USERNAME'* variable with the username of the created database user, and the *'DB_URI'* variable with the part of your connection string ( **YOUR_OWN_MONGODB_URI**) that starts with *@cluster*...:


The application works as follows. Navigate from your terminal inside the /src/backend directory and execute the command:

* **node mongo.js *yourpassword*:** to display all of the entries in the phonebook database

* **node mongo.js *yourpassword* *name* *number*:** to create an entry in the phonebook database

For example the command


        node mongo.js *yourpassword* Anna 040-1234556


will print:

        added Anna number 040-1234556 to phonebook


And the new entry to the phonebook will be saved to the database. Notice that if the name contains whitespace characters, it must be enclosed in quotes:


        node mongo.js *yourpassword* "Katerina Tziala" 040-1234556


## Testing the API

In order to test the endpoinds of the API make sure that the server is running locally, as stated above, before sending any request.

### Testing the API with POSTMAN:

If you test the *PhoneBook API* with [**Postman**](https://www.getpostman.com/):

* To get the info of the *PhoneBook App* send a **GET** request to
    ```
        http://localhost:3001/api/info
    ```
    as illustrated in the following figure:

    <br/>
* To get the list of all persons in the database send a **GET** request to
    ```
        http://localhost:3001/api/persons
    ```

### Testing the API on Visual Studio Code:

If you use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), install the [**VS Code REST client plugin**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) and execute the requests in the *'requests'* directory.

**Note:** In order to execute the *delete_person* and *get_single_person* requests make sure that you change the ***ID*** part of the request with a **valid** id.
